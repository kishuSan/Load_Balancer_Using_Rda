# 🦌 Red Deer Algorithm (RDA) for Cloud Load Balancing  

This project implements the **Red Deer Algorithm (RDA)** in **CloudSim** for efficient **cloud load balancing**.  
RDA is a nature-inspired metaheuristic algorithm modeled on the mating behavior of red deer, adapted here for **cloudlet-to-VM mapping** to optimize system performance.

## 🚀 Features  
- Implementation of **RDA phases**: roaring, fighting, and mating  
- **QoS-aware fitness function** considering:  
  - Makespan  
  - Resource utilization  
  - Execution cost  
  - Response time  
- Comparative analysis with **Genetic Algorithm (GA)** and **Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO)**  
- CloudSim-based simulation framework

## 📊 Results  
- **Lower makespan** compared to GA and GWO  
- **Higher resource utilization** with balanced load distribution  
- Improved **system response time** and **reduced cost**
